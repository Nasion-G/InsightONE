# Backend API Design for Smart SME Dashboard

## Overview
This directory contains the API design and documentation for the Smart SME Dashboard backend. The API will be designed to support the following key functionalities:
- User authentication and role-based access control
- MSISDN management (assignment, monitoring, and updates)
- Usage monitoring and analytics
- Alerts and notifications
- Self-service operations

## API Design
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT, 2FA via OTP
- **Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for user management, MSISDN operations, usage data, and alerts
- **Mock Data**: Initial mock responses for development and testing

## Next Steps
1. Define OpenAPI/Swagger specification for key endpoints
2. Implement mock API endpoints for development
3. Integrate with frontend for testing
4. Review and iterate based on feedback
